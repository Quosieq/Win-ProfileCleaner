# Win-ProfileCleaner
Check C:\Users and remove (with option to archive) any user who hasn't logged in more than 90 days (or other specified time)

For now only Archve function works

Semi working version for now 
Known issue - for some reason sometimes it doesn't just search for .dat file but tries to archive active profiles
